## 🗃️ Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of:
- `orders.csv` – order IDs, dates, customer IDs, and total amount
- `customers.csv` – basic customer information
- `order_items.csv` – product-level transaction details

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Applied
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregates: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`
- `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`
- Subqueries with `IN`, `HAVING`, `AVG()`
- Creating and using `VIEWS`
- Date-based grouping using `strftime()`
